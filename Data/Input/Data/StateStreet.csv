"State Street	""Graduate DevOps Engineer – Cloud Native Service InfrastructureIn January 2018", we launched one of the industry’s largest technical transformation projects, in effect building a new bank from the ground up. This project isn’t greenfield in the way most banks claim projects are; we’ve started with a blank sheet of paper both operationally and technically. We’re using the same technologies that Silicon Valley giants are using: aggressive use of multiple public clouds, building our own private cloud to achieve even better performance, pushing out microservices into what will be one of the largest Kubernetes installations in the world, leveraging immutable storage to process and store hundreds of terabytes of data a day, transforming our industry through application of distributed ledger technology and cognitive computing, aggressively participating in open source communities driving our systems. This role is to join an international team that is responsible for our shared infrastructure in the Cloud Native Computing ecosystem. The platform that we are responsible for is based on Kubernetes (pure upstream: we believe in Kubernetes The Hard Way) along with a host of other ancillary technologies (such as fluentd, envoy, Istio, Calico, Helm). The team’s remit is a true 24x7 DevOps mandate. We are a geographically distributed team, with engineering hubs in London, Belfast, and Austin, Texas.What You’d Be Working OnThis team supports our Kubernetes-based clusters in a DevOps fashion.We engineer automated deployment of infrastructure technologies.We develop multi-stage pipelines for infrastructure changes and deploymentsWe develop operational playbooks (as we perform some operational support functions and act as first-line support for all our client teams)We engage in automated infrastructure testing and continuous monitoringWe develop fault tolerant systems in modern cloud environments (AWS, OpenStack, etc.)We work in a Kanban-style agile fashionWe don’t expect you to have done all of these things. We offer an environment with senior experts in all of these areas and the specific technologies we use (such as Terraform, Ansible, GitHub Enterprise, CloudFormation, Concourse), and we’ll help mentor you in a rigorous, engineering approach to all those technologies.What We’re Looking ForWe’re looking for graduates that have a sound foundation of technical principles. You don’t have to come from a computing background, many of our employees have engineering or scientific degrees. Experience with (through academic coursework or self-evaluation) the technologies we use and support is useful, though not required. Experience in one or more commonly used programming languages (e.g. Python, Go," Java) is strongly preferred.But mostly we’re looking for candidates who are interested in the types of technologies we’re working with and are eager to join the team in charge of one of the largest Kubernetes infrastructures in financial services.  ""	Graduate DevOps Engineer – Cloud Native Service Infrastructure	https://statestreet.wd1.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/Global/job/London-England/Graduate-DevOps-Engineer---Cloud-Native-Service-Infrastructure_R-602023",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
